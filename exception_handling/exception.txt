Types of error:
1. Grammatical
2. semtatical
3. Logical

1st and 2nd are  handled by compiler.
3rd is runtime error 
As these are handled by java , this is why java is roburst.

Error : When code gets abnormally terminated and does not able to reach the end of code.

Exception : When code gets run and reach its final end but does not able to provide the desired output.
Those runtime error which can be handled by programmer that add roburstess to java.

Runtime error is represented by an object. There exits class JRE for describing runtime errors.

TO handle exception java has made standard class to handle exception

Heirarchy of exception handling :
Most super class is Throwable :
have 2 - sub classes(non-abstract) : Exception(can be handled) and Error(cannot be handled)

Some of the subclass of exception :
1. ArthematicException
2. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
3. NullPointerException
4. NumberFormatException

Some of the subclass of error : 
1. VirtualMachineError
2. StackOverFlowError
3. NoSuchMethodError
4. NoClassDefFoundError

Checked and Unchecked exception :
Checked : checked during compile time and handling by compiler itself
    (InterruptException, SQLException, IOxception, etc are all checked exception)

Unchecked : checked during runtime and handled at runtime itself
    (RuntimeException, Error are all Unchecked exception)
