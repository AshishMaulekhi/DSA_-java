Java Strings is basically an object that represent sequence of char value. An array of characters works same as java String.

    OR
    String s = "java"; //literal object

CharSequence interface has 3 classes : 
1. String

Wheneverwe change any String , a new instance is created for mutable Strings.
You can use StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes.
